# Kata time

## What is a Kata?

A kata is a programming exercise that you practice repeatedly to improve your skills. Through deliberate practice and repetition, you develop muscle memory for good coding habits, TDD workflows, and collaborative programming techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Start the development environment:

    ```bash
    make env-start
    ```

2. Run the tests to verify everything works:

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

3. Start practicing! Begin the TDD cycle with your pair.

    ```bash
    make rotate "description of what you did"
    ```
