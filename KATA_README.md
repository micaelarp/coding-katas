# Global Guide for Katas 🚀

This file describes the general organization and session dynamics for all katas in this repository.

## 🗂️ Organization
- Each subfolder corresponds to a different kata.
- Inside each kata folder you will find:
  - Kata description and objectives
  - Specific rules and limitations
  - Tests and base code

## 🗓️ Session Plan
1. **Introduction to the topic to practice** (15 min)
   - Brief explanation of key concepts (e.g., SOLID, TDD, refactoring, etc.)
2. **Kata execution** (40 min)
   - Team work following the proposed dynamic
3. **Team presentations** (10 min)
   - Each team shares their solution and learnings
4. **Retrospective** (5 min)
   - Space for feedback and closing

## ⚔️ General Dynamics
- **Format:** Pair Programming (Ping-Pong)
- **Rotation:** Switch roles every 5 minutes
    - 💡 Use `make rotate -- "Rotation message"` to auto-test and commit

## 🔤 Kata Letter and Limitations
Each kata will have:
- **Letter:** Brief description of the main objective
- **Limitations:** Optional restrictions to increase the challenge (e.g., no mouse, no AI, communication only through code, etc.)
