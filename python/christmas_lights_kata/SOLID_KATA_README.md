# SOLID Kata - Christmas Lights Edition 🎄

Welcome to the SOLID Kata session! Today we will be practicing software design principles and refactoring techniques using the classic **Christmas Lights** exercise.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Apply SOLID Principles**
- **Refactoring**: Improve code structure without changing behavior.
- **Pair Programming**: Collaborate and learn from your partner.

## 📅 Schedule

1.  **Intro to SOLID** (by Nabeel) - Brief refresher on the principles. (20 mins)
2.  **Kata Execution** - Hands-on coding in pairs.  (40 mins)
3.  **Retrospective** - Share learnings and discuss challenges. (20 mins)

## 🎄 The Kata: Christmas Lights

We will be working on the **Christmas Lights** kata.

👉 **[Read the full Kata Requirements here](instructions.md)**
🔗 **Original Source**: [https://kata-log.rocks/christmas-lights-kata](https://kata-log.rocks/christmas-lights-kata)

**Goal**: Develop an API that manipulates a grid of Christmas lights according to a set of instructions.
**Focus**: How can we design this so adding new commands or behaviors is easy?

## ⚔️ Dynamics & Rules

- **Format**: Pair Programming.
- **Style**: Ping-Pong.
    - **Ping**: Person A writes a failing test.
    - **Pong**: Person B writes the code to pass the test.
    - **Refactor**: Both refactor together.
    - **Swap**: Person B writes the next failing test.
- **Rotation**: Switch roles every **5 minutes**.
    - 💡 **Tip**: Use `make rotate "Refactored Christmas Lights"` to auto-run tests and commit!

### 🌶️ Spicy Constraints 
- **🙅‍♀️ No AI Assistance**: Solve the kata without AI tools so the focus stays on design thinking and collaboration.
- **Baby steps**: Only add one feature or refactor at a time.
